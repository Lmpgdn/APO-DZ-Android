One semester and [one iPhone app later](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apo-dz/id862246150?mt=8&uo=4), the [original, highly hacky version](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-Android/releases/tag/v0.1) of this app was born during the weekend of [Pennapps Fall 2014](http://2014s.pennapps.com/).\r\n\r\n[Nikila Dandapani](@nikilad) is in charge of design and UX as of July 2014.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n* [Google GSON](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) for JSON object de/serialization\r\n\r\n### Other Contributors\r\nThank you to Daniela Lissandrello for her help with Photoshop, to [Han Loh](@lianhanloh) for his work during Pennapps, to Tiff Lu for designing the original app icon,  and to Jackie Chow for her support.\r\n\r\n### Our Chapter\r\nThe Delta Zeta chapter is based at the University of Pennsylvania. Please visit [our website](upennapo.org) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Privacy\r\nNone of your personal information leaves your phone.
