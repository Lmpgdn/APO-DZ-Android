==================
_This is the repo for the Android version. You can find the iOS repo [here](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-iOS)._

As an free alternative to the subscription [APO Online](http://www.apoonline.org/index.php) tool, the Delta Zeta Chapter uses a collection of Google Calendars, Sheets, and Forms to facilitate service project/event sign-up and viewing, record keeping, and membership registry. The APO app was built to consolidate these resources on smartphones and is able to access the existing cloud modules so that brothers can quickly check their service progress, report and create events on the public calendars, and (most helpfully, so we hear) easily find and contact other members of our chapter.

On a more abstract level, this native Android app implements adaptable methods for providing mobile access for multiple Google resources. While it was built to interface with Delta Zeta's cloud infrastructure, the techniques we have used are easily replicable; as part of the [2014 Tri-Sectional Conference](http://upennapo.org/trisectionals/), we created a suite of template Google Sheets that can be adapted along with this app to create your own cloud-based infrastructure and corresponding mobile app.

## Download
This app is currently available for Android devices (4.0+) and iPhones (iOS 7.0+). You can download them from the respective app stores, but keep in mind the app is password-locked to protect user privacy.

## Making It Your Own
Please see the [project wiki](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/APO-DZ-Android/wiki) for information on the app structure, adaptable components, and producing your own version of the app. The wiki is currently in progress, so just reach out to us if you have any questions.

In particular, you'll need to create a string XML resource file with your spreadsheet keys and the like before your forks will build.
